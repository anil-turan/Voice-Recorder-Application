This code is designed to record audio using a microphone connected to the computer. 
It prompts the user to input the duration for how long they want to record and the name they want to give to the recorded file. 
After the recording is complete, it saves the audio as a WAV file with the specified file name. 
The code uses two main libraries: "sounddevice" for recording the audio and "scipy" to save the recorded audio into a WAV file.
